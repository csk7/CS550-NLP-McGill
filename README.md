## References

For language modelling, we built our code on top of the vanilla (32-bit floating point) LSTM implementation  included  in  Salesforceâ€™s  LSTM  Language  Model  Toolkit    [Merity et al.,2017](https://github.com/salesforce/awd-lstm-lm) (BSD-3 License).    
For neural machine translation, our code is similarly built on top of the vanilla LSTM implementation of OpenNMT  [Klein et al.,2017](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py). (MIT License)
